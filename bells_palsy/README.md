# Bells Palsy Clinical Trial Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing clinical trial data for regulatory submission.

## Workflow
- **Raw Data → SDTM → ADaM → TLF → Define-XML**
- Implemented using SAS programming (macros, arrays) and validated outputs.

## Outputs
- SDTM: `DM`, `AE`, `LB`
- ADaM: `ADSL`, `ADLB`, `ADAE`
- TLF: Demographics summary, AE listing, HbA1c change plots
- Metadata: `define.xml`

## Skills Demonstrated
- CDISC SDTM/ADaM implementation
- SAS macro programming
- TLF generation and validation
- Regulatory submission standards
